### Task

Write a Java application called **Density.java** which calculates the density of an object given its mass and volume. 

The formula for density is:

**𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = Mass/Volume**

Your output should be in the following format:

<p>Mass = 40.0 kg<br>
Volume = 8.0 metres cubed<br>
Density = 5.00 kg per metre cubed<p>


Note that the **mass and volume** are output to **1 decimal place** whereas the **density** is output to **2 decimal places.**
